title: How to make carnitas
---

I often make this recipe for my friends and family. While it takes a little time, it requires minimal effort aside from the prep work. I originally got this recipe from ~[Kenji](https://youtube.com/@jkenjilopezalt?si=dMpl9jjU67YFHwYL)~ and tweaked it. All you need is a knife, cutting board, baking sheet, and a Dutch oven (or a similar high-walled cast iron pan).

**Ingredients**
- Pork shoulder
- White onion
- Garlic
- Oranges
- Jalape√±o
- Habanero 
- Cinnamon sticks
- Bay leaf 
- Cumin
- Salt and peppercorns
- 3 beers ;)
- Vegetable oil
- Cilantro
- Limes

**Directions**
1. Preheat the oven to 275F
2. Cut up the pork shoulder into 1-2 inch cubes. Cut up onions and oranges into similar sized wedges. 
3. Add pork, onions, oranges and garlic to the Dutch oven. 
4. Add vegetable oil, salt, peppercorns, cumin,  bay leaf, and cinnamon sticks and mix it up 
5. Put this in the oven for 3.5 hours or until it falls apart when poked with a fork.
6. Pull it out of the oven and move all the pork  onto the baking sheet, leaving all the veg I the Dutch oven
7. Broil the pork on the baking sheet on high until it gets all crispy
8. Serve on tortillas with cilantro, onions, lime and salsa!

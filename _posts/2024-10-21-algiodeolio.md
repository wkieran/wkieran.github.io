title: Bronson's Aglio de Olio
---

This is the week before my first (hopefully not last) marathon. My goal is sub 4 hours, but I think I might be able to crank out sub 3:45. This is all 5 months after finishing my undergrad and 3 months into my first full-time job. I went all out training for this; I bought some super shoes and running tights so I don't chafe, and I work from home so I have no excuse for not having time to run. I am trying to eat all sorts of carbs and electrolytes so I am using it as an excuse to get luxurious and extravagant in the kitchen. So there might be more recipes.

This is just another easy post about an easy meal to make. You will need a stainless steel pan and a good sized pot. This one is from an old youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i8iEFBok0) of Action Bronson and this time I have photos. I barely tweaked it again, this one is mega fast.

**Ingredients**
- Garlic (mince)
- Dried chilies your mom brought back from New Mexico
- The virginest of olive oils, green
- Spaghetti
- Basil
- Parsley (chopped)
- Salt and pepper
- Shrimp (shelled, deveined)
- Anchovies (mashed)
- lemon (zested, and halved)

Directions
1. First cook all your spaghetti, you should know how. Try and use little water to boil, and save all of it afterwards. Put pasta aside.
2. Heat olive oil in a stainless steel pan until it shimmers.
3. Add some anchovy filets into the oil, get fragrant.
4. Add chopped up chillies, let them get color.
5. Then add the garlic and lemon, don't let it burn.
6. Add ur shrimp next, let them cook, maybe baste them a little. Flip them to finish cooking.
7. Shred and add the basil with your hands.
8. When shrimp is almost cooked through add pasta to the pan and mix it all up.
9. Bit by bit add pasta water while mixing the pasta to make it saucy, the oil and starch in the pasta water should make magic. This is called emulsion. Don't overdo it.
10. When you like where you're at, salt and pepper to taste.
11. Add the parsley and some lemon juice at the very end.
12. Serve it and get complimented. Take full credit for the recipe.
